## 3. Errors
  -No known errors.

## 4. References used
   -https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/ This site had the basic foundation for setting up a CNN on MNIST, and was the baseline off which much of my program was built.
        
   -ChatGPT: Menial debugging assistance and python syntax help.
 
   -Ponthea Zahraii: Ponthea was an immensely valuable source for me, and helped counterbalance my lack of prior knowledge by supplementing her own at most every stage of the project. She helped me with making plots for graphs and visual data on model success, random forest creation, and more. Pretty much the only part that I did fully independently of her assistance was the specifics of the model creation/layers.
